# Spot2 AI â€“ Conversational Real Estate Assistant

Spot2 AI is a web application that guides users through a simple conversation to collect real estate requirements, using OpenAI's language model behind the scenes.

It has a FastAPI backend that handles API requests and OpenAI interactions, and a Streamlit frontend for the user interface. The app is containerized using Docker, and dependency management is handled with uv.
